### Using Flies to Understand Social Networks

#### Abstract

aid 帮助
> Social network analysis (SNA) is a statistical tool that ***aids in*** revealing and understanding the organized patterns of shared social connections between individuals in groups.

application 应用、实施
solitary 独自的、独居的
organism 生物、有机体
inherit 继承、遗传
> The ***application*** of SNA revealed that Drosophila melanogaster, previously considered a ***solitary*** ***organism***, displays group dynamics and that the structure of group life is ***inherited***.

investigate 研究
adress 解决、着手解决
a wide array of 大量的、各种各样的
> Although the number of studies ***investigating*** Drosophila social networks is currently limited, they ***address*** ***a wide array of*** questions that have only begun to capture the details of group level behavior in this insect.

respective 各自的
scope 范围、领域
draw parallels between A and B 找到A和B之间的相通点
> Here, we aim to review these studies, comparing their ***respective scopes*** and the methods used, to ***draw parallels between*** them and the broader body of knowledge available.

#### Introduction

manifestation 表现形式、显现
> Collective behavior can be defined as a ***manifestation*** of group-level patterns produced by simple interactions between individuals.

>Animals display ***a wealth of*** interesting collective behaviors such as ***migrating geese*** flying in V-shaped formation.

illustrate 说明，阐明
morphology 形态学
physiology 生理学
swarm 一大群（飞行中的昆虫）
>The African ***migratory locust illustrates*** this phenomenon: crowded group conditions alter the ***morphology, physiology***, and behavior of individual locusts, resulting in aggressive ***swarms***

manipulate 操纵，控制
composition 成分、创作
>Similarly, ***manipulating group composition*** in the fruit fly affects the mating behavior and cuticular hydrocarbon profile of individuals through differences in gene expression

numerous 众多的
>The relationship between individual interactions and collective behavior of animal groups can be studied in ***numerous*** ways.
